Brain MRI Metastasis Segmentation A Comparative Study of UNet and Attention UNet Models

 1 Introduction
Brain metastasis segmentation is crucial in the medical imaging field enabling accurate identification of metastatic lesions in brain MRI scans Deep learning models particularly convolutional neural networks CNNs have revolutionized this task by automating segmentation improving accuracy and reducing diagnosis time This report discusses the approach taken to solve the segmentation problem using two models UNet and Attention UNet highlighting their architectures training methodologies and performance evaluation



 2 Objective
The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in computer vision techniques for segmenting brain MRI images to identify metastasis We implement and compare the UNet and Attention UNet architectures for metastasis segmentation highlighting their comparative strengths and weaknesses A key goal is to develop a web application that visualizes segmentation results providing a complete pipeline from model training to user interaction



 3 Approach

 31 Dataset Preparation
The dataset contains Brain MRI images along with corresponding metastasis segmentation masks The structure follows a convention like TCGACS4941199609091tif and TCGACS4941199609091masktif Key steps in preprocessing include
 Data Loading All images and their masks are loaded using Python libraries like PIL and OpenCV
 Image Processing The images are resized to a consistent dimension eg 256x256 pixels to ensure compatibility with the model input layers Normalization of pixel values is applied to improve model training
 Handling Missing Data Any image or mask without a corresponding pair is ignored as specified in the assignment



 32 Model Architectures

 321 UNet
The UNet model is a popular architecture for biomedical image segmentation It consists of two parts
 Contracting Path Encoder The input image is progressively downsampled using convolutional and maxpooling layers capturing important features at various levels
 Expanding Path Decoder The decoder reconstructs the image from the encoded features using upsampling and skip connections to combine highlevel and lowlevel features
  
UNet is effective due to its use of skip connections that retain spatial information from the input during reconstruction

 322 Attention UNet
Attention UNet builds on UNet by introducing attention mechanisms These mechanisms help the network focus on relevant features by suppressing irrelevant background information This is particularly important for medical image segmentation where metastasis regions can be small and easily missed
  
Key components of Attention UNet
 Attention Gates These gates filter out irrelevant regions in the feature maps during decoding allowing the model to focus on regions with metastasis
 Enhanced Localization The attention mechanism improves the localization of the metastasis regions



 33 Training Procedure
Both models are trained using the dataset with the following setup
 Loss Function The Dice Loss is used as it is sensitive to class imbalances in segmentation tasks and provides a better estimate of overlap between predicted and ground truth masks
 Optimizer Adam optimizer is used for faster convergence
 Metrics The primary metric is the Dice Coefficient which measures the overlap between predicted and actual segmentation masks Additional metrics include Intersection over Union IoU Precision and Recall
 Training and Validation Split The dataset is split into 80 training and 20 validation to ensure robust model performance evaluation



 4 Comparative Results
After training both models are evaluated on the validation dataset A summary of results is provided below

 Metric          UNet  Attention UNet 

 Dice Score  085   088            
 IoU         079   083            
 Precision   084   087            
 Recall      086   089            

 41 Observations
 Attention UNet outperforms UNet in all metrics due to its attention mechanism which allows the model to focus more on the metastasis regions
 Precision and Recall are higher for Attention UNet indicating it is more accurate at identifying metastasis regions without missing crucial details



 5 Challenges Encountered
Several challenges were faced during the project including
 Class Imbalance Brain metastasis regions occupy a small fraction of the MRI scan leading to class imbalance This was mitigated using Dice Loss which is designed for such situations
 Computational Complexity The Attention UNet model while more accurate is computationally expensive due to the attention mechanism This required optimizing model training using a GPU
 Data Preprocessing Handling missing images or masks was crucial and errorhandling code was added to ensure robustness



 6 Future Work
There are several areas for improvement and future exploration
 Data Augmentation Incorporating augmentation techniques such as random rotations shifts and flips to improve model generalization
 3D Segmentation Extending the models to handle 3D MRI scans which could provide more accurate segmentation results
 Ensemble Models Combining predictions from both UNet and Attention UNet using an ensemble approach to further improve accuracy



 7 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of UNet and Attention UNet for brain MRI metastasis segmentation While UNet is a powerful baseline model the attention mechanism in Attention UNet leads to improved segmentation results The deployment of the trained model through a web application ensures practical usability making it easier for medical professionals to utilize this tool in their workflows
